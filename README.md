# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
- Analyze data on student funding and student test scores
- Breakdown math and reading scores based on grade, school, and school type
- Tasked to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance
- Present data to school board to assist in making decisions regarding school budget allotments

### Challenge Overview
- School board discovered cases of Academic Dishonesty at a particular school
- I was tasked with replacing scores for those students with "Nans" to adjust the data
- The rest of the data needs to be fully intact, only adjusting the math and reading scores from that school

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv; students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Conda 4.13.0, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8, Pandas 1.4.3
- MSU Bootcamp Spot Module 4: https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2508/assignments/31963?module_item_id=634879

- Changing the data from Thomas High School did not affect the total number of schools, students, or the budget. 
- Based on the images above, the data for reading and math scores was also unchanged.
